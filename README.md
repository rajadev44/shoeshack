# ShoeShack - Ecommerce Website Built with ReactJS
ShoeShack is a modern and responsive ecommerce website that has been meticulously crafted to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers seeking high-quality shoes. Leveraging the power of the latest web technologies, I created ShoeShack website that not only looks visually appealing but also delivers exceptional performance and functionality. At the heart of this project lies the ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library that has revolutionized the way developers approach building user interfaces. By embracing the component-based architecture and virtual DOM of ReactJS, the ShoeShack website is able to deliver a fast and efficient user experience, with smooth interactions and lightning-fast load times. This commitment to performance and user experience is further enhanced by the use of Vite, a next-generation build tool that optimizes the development and build process, ensuring that the website is always running at its best.

Features: 
- Visually appealing UI Design
- Responsive design for optimal experience across multiple screens
- Extensive product catalog with high-quality images and descriptions.
- Seamless shopping cart and checkout experience.
- Authentication for users
- Robust category filtering and min-max price filtering capabilities. 

Technologies used:
- ReactJS Front-end: The website is built using the powerful ReactJS library, ensuring a fast and efficient user experience. ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and efficient rendering. By leveraging ReactJS, the ShoeShack website can deliver a smooth and responsive user interface, with fast load times and seamless interactions.
- Shadcn & TailwindCSS: The website's styling is handled by the Shadcn UI library and the utility-first CSS framework, TailwindCSS. Shadcn is a collection of accessible, customizable, and production-ready components for React, built on top of Tailwind CSS. TailwindCSS is a popular CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined utility classes, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently style their components without the need for complex CSS selectors or class names.
- SheetDB.io API: The mock data for the website is fetched from the SheetDB.io API, allowing for easy integration and management of product information. SheetDB.io is a service that allows you to create a RESTful API from a Google Sheet, making it a convenient and flexible solution for managing and serving data for the ShoeShack website.
- Yup Input Validation: The Yup library is used to implement robust input validation, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. Yup is a schema validation library that allows you to define validation rules for your form inputs, making it easier to handle user input and provide meaningful error messages.
- Firebase Authentication: The website integrates Firebase Authentication, allowing users to securely sign in and manage their accounts. Firebase is a comprehensive app development platform that provides a suite of tools and services, including authentication, which makes it easy to implement secure user authentication in the ShoeShack website.
- Redux State Management: The Redux library is used to manage the application's state, ensuring a predictable and scalable state management solution. Redux is a popular state management library for JavaScript applications, including React-based projects. By using Redux, the ShoeShack website can maintain a centralized and predictable state, making it easier to manage complex application logic and ensure consistent behavior across different components.
